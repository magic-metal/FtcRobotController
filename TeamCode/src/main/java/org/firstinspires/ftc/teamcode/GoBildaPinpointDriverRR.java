     * Send a position that the Pinpoint should use to track your robot relative to. You can use this to
     * update the estimated position of your robot with new external sensor data, or to run a robot
     * in field coordinates. <br><br>
     * This overrides the current position. <br><br>
     * <strong>Using this feature to track your robot's position in field coordinates:</strong> <br>
     * When you start your code, send a Pose2D that describes the starting position on the field of your robot. <br>
     * Say you're on the red alliance, your robot is against the wall and closer to the audience side,
     * and the front of your robot is pointing towards the center of the field.
     * You can send a setPosition with something like -600mm x, -1200mm Y, and 90 degrees. The pinpoint would then always
     * keep track of how far away from the center of the field you are. <br><br>
     * <strong>Using this feature to update your position with additional sensors: </strong><br>
     * Some robots have a secondary way to locate their robot on the field. This is commonly
     * Apriltag localization in FTC, but it can also be something like a distance sensor.
     * Often these external sensors are absolute (meaning they measure something about the field)
     * so their data is very accurate. But they can be slower to read, or you may need to be in a very specific
     * position on the field to use them. In that case, spend most of your time relying on the Pinpoint
     * to determine your location. Then when you pull a new position from your secondary sensor,
     * send a setPosition command with the new position. The Pinpoint will then track your movement
     * relative to that new, more accurate position.
     *
     * @param pos a Pose2D describing the robot's new position.
