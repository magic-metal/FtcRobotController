### Java

#### Object Oriented

### Back to GitHub

- [ ] Revisit Our Github Process
- [ ] Revisit the use of GitHub Issues (and Projects)
- [ ] Document as Code (Readme and other forms)
- [ ] Something Else that you are interested 
## Crawl

### A crawl around the FTC SDK

- [ ] Learn how to use Objects available in SDK

## Walk

### Tools
- [ ] Diagram as Code (Optional)
